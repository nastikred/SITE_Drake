It's ideal oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone
Got you trippin' got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
All this time this ain't you
I decide when we're through

	I love, you love
	This love,
	We're professional.
	I know, you know
	We're sophisticated
	At loving

What does it mean
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes it's way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again
Oh yeah!

I love, you love
	This love,
	We're professional.
	I know, you know
	We're sophisticated
	At loving

All of those nights you were up early holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself all when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oh, how did you drain, all the soul from your eyes
How did you teach, teach yourself, how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real? No
Every touch that you sell is a lie

I love, you love
	This love,
	We're professional.
	I know, you know
	We're sophisticated
	At loving

  	You did many things
	That I liked, that I liked
	And you like diamond rings
	I can provide, I can provide for you
	You made me feel so good
	Before I left
	On the road
	And you deserve your name
	On a crown, on a throne
	You did many things
	That I liked, that I liked
	And you like diamond rings
	I can provide, I can provide for you
	You made me feel so good
	Before I left
	On the road
	And you deserve your name
	On a crown, on a throne

I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize, but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
On me
But I remember on the bathroom floor
'Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

Honey, please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in (we)
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

We
Who?
Oooh...
Oooooooh...
No ho...
Let her know...

When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us

The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

	But I chose the life
	I chose the life
	Then I realized
	She might have been the one
	I let it go
	For a little fun
	I made a trade
	Gave away our days
	For a little fame
	Now I'll never see your face
	But it's okay I adapted anyway

Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

	Because I chose the life
	I chose the life
	Then I realized
	She might have been the one
	I let it go
	For a little fun
	I made a trade
	Gave away our days
	For a little fame
	Now I'll never see your face
	But it's okay I adapted anyway
	She might just be the one
	She might just be the one
	She might just be the one
	She might just be the one

The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye


<a name=4>  </a>Love In The Sky <embed src=9.mp3 height=60 width=144>

There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back
You've been here before
Remember these sheets?
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream

There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I could teach you to dream, oooh

	We'll find our love in the sky
	We'll find our love in the sky
	We'll find our love in the sky
	We'll find our love in the sky
	We'll find our love in the sky
	We'll find our love in the sky

How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control


<a name=5>  </a>Belong To The World <embed src=10.mp3 height=60 width=144>

The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

		I'm not a fool
		I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
		I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
		But you taught me how to feel
		When nobody ever would
		And you taught me how to love
		When nobody ever could

	Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
	And learn to mistreat you
	'Cause you belong to the world
	And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
	Domesticate you
	But you belong to the world

And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby

		I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
		I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
		I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)
		But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
		When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
		And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
		When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)

	Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
	And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
	'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
	And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)
	Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
	But you belong to the world (Oh baby)

You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream

	Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
	And learn to mistreat you
	'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
	And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
	Domesticate you
	But you belong to the world

You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
